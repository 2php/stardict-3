Directory layout of Stardict source tree
----------------------------------------

- debian-upstream
contains Debian OS specific files
Do not name this directory "debian", that complicates Stardict packaging for
Debian. See http://people.debian.org/~mpalmer/debian-mentors_FAQ.html,
question "What's wrong with upstream shipping a debian/ directory?" for more
details.

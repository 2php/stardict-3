You need Microsoft Visual studio 2003 to compile the Acrobat plug-in.
The Acrobat SDK 7 is needed too, copy headers files from "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Acrobat 7.0.5 SDK\PluginSupport\Headers" to "Acrobat_Headers" in this directory.

This plug-in only work on Abode Acrobat Professional currently. For Adobe Reader, a License is needed, which will cost $2,500, this has not be done yet.
